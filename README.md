Go to tagged-pc-using-LLM/tagged-PC/run_tag_pc.py to run Tag PC.

This code was build upon the code fo the "Typing assumptions improve identification in causal discovery" paper by Brouillard et al. (https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.10703). Go to https://github.com/ServiceNow/typed-dag/tree/main check out their code.

This code contains the experiment and code for "Leveraging Multi-Tag Relations for Robust Causal Discovery" - the bachelor thesis of Florian Guldan.
